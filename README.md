# F22_Federated_Learning_Fashion_Images

## Overview
As fashion/clothing trends change rapidly, old models may not apply to new designs, and new datasets will be needed for learning. 
Our project aims to use federated learning to train models between nodes to continuously improve the model. 
This will make the model more relevant to the evolving fashion trends.
